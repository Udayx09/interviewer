# Masterplan: Interview Preparator App (MVP v1.0 - Screening Round)

## 1. Introduction

*   **Vision:** A web application designed to help tech students and job seekers practice for interviews and build confidence.
*   **Problem Solved:** Addresses interview anxiety, lack of realistic practice opportunities, and the need for constructive feedback.
*   **Target Audience (MVP):** College students and job seekers applying for technical roles (e.g., Software Engineer, Data Analyst).
*   **Initial Focus (MVP):** Deliver a robust simulation of the initial **Screening Round** of a typical tech interview process.

## 2. Core Features (MVP - Screening Round Module)

*   **Platform:** Responsive Web Application (accessible via browser on desktop and mobile).
*   **Personalization:** Users input their Target Role, Experience Level, and Key Skills/Technologies to tailor the simulation.
*   **AI-Powered Questions:** Utilizes the Gemini AI model to generate relevant screening questions based on user input (focusing on behavioral, logistical, and role-interest questions).
*   **Simulation Flow:**
    *   Presents one question at a time.
    *   Includes a configurable per-question timer (e.g., 3 minutes) to add pressure.
    *   Displays questions clearly (e.g., large, bold text).
    *   Provides a dedicated text input area for user answers.
    *   Uses a "Submit and Next" button to progress; prevents revisiting previous questions.
    *   Includes subtle UI elements (logo, indicator) to enhance the simulation feel.
*   **AI-Powered Feedback:**
    *   Upon session completion, displays an "Analyzing..." indicator.
    *   Provides a performance score.
    *   Offers AI-assisted textual feedback on the user's answers (analyzing clarity, relevance, conciseness).
    *   Suggests potential areas for improvement and may link to generic resources.
*   **Anti-Cheating Mechanisms:**
    *   Disables copy/paste functionality within the answer input field.
    *   Detects browser tab switching during the simulation (e.g., provides a warning).

## 3. User Experience (UX) Flow - Screening Simulation Page

1.  User initiates a practice screening session after providing role/skill details.
2.  The page displays the first AI-generated question prominently with the timer counting down.
3.  User types their answer into the provided text box.
4.  User clicks "Submit and Next". The answer is captured, and the next question is displayed. The previous question/answer is no longer accessible.
5.  Steps 3-4 repeat for the duration of the screening round simulation (e.g., a set number of questions).
6.  After the final question is submitted, a brief loading/analyzing animation is shown.
7.  The feedback page/section is displayed, showing the score, tips, and resources.

## 4. Technical Architecture (High-Level Recommendations)

*   **Frontend:** Responsive Web App. Consider standard frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, or potentially simpler HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the MVP depending on team familiarity. Use standard practices for responsiveness.
*   **Backend:** A server-side application (e.g., using Node.js, Python/Flask/Django, Ruby on Rails) to:
    *   Handle user requests.
    *   Manage simulation state temporarily.
    *   Interface securely with the Gemini API (sending prompts based on user input, sending answers for feedback analysis).
    *   Implement anti-cheating logic (server-side validation where possible).
*   **AI Integration:** Use the official Google Cloud SDK or Gemini API for interactions. Carefully craft prompts for both question generation and feedback analysis. Manage API keys securely on the backend.
*   **Data Storage (MVP):** Minimal persistent storage needed initially.
    *   Focus on managing the *temporary* state of an active simulation session.
    *   No long-term storage of user Q&A history required for MVP. (This can be added later with a database like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc., if user accounts and history are implemented).

## 5. Security Considerations (MVP)

*   **Transport Layer Security:** Use HTTPS for all communication between the browser and the backend server.
*   **API Key Security:** Store the Gemini API key securely on the backend; never expose it in the frontend code.
*   **Input Validation:** Implement basic validation on user inputs (role, skills, answers) on the backend to prevent common security issues (e.g., injection attacks).
*   **Rate Limiting (Future):** Consider basic rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse.

## 6. Development Phases (Suggested)

*   **Phase 1 (MVP):** Build the Screening Round module as defined above. Focus on core simulation flow, AI integration for questions/feedback (text-based), and basic anti-cheating. Minimalist UI.
*   **Phase 2:** Introduce user accounts (signup/login). Implement persistent storage for user profiles and practice session history (allowing users to review past attempts). Build the user dashboard.
*   **Phase 3:** Design and develop simulation modules for other interview rounds (e.g., Skills Assessment, Technical Round - potentially introducing code editors or different question types, Final Round). Explore voice input/output if desired.
*   **Phase 4:** Add advanced features based on user feedback: more detailed analytics, potentially specific learning resource recommendations, integrations (e.g., calendar, job boards), team/collaboration features.

## 7. Potential Challenges

*   **AI Quality & Consistency:** Ensuring Gemini consistently generates high-quality, relevant questions and insightful feedback requires careful prompt engineering and testing.
*   **AI Costs:** Managing API usage costs as the user base grows. Optimizing prompts and potentially exploring different models/tiers.
*   **Meaningful Feedback:** Designing the feedback mechanism (scoring + tips) to be genuinely helpful and actionable for users based purely on text analysis.
*   **Anti-Cheating Robustness:** Implementing anti-cheating measures that are effective without being overly intrusive or easy to bypass.
*   **User Adoption:** Clearly communicating the value proposition and attracting the target audience.

## 8. Next Steps

1.  Review this `masterplan.md` document.
2.  Provide feedback: Does this accurately capture the vision for the MVP? Are there any misunderstandings or missing pieces?
3.  Refine the plan based on feedback.
4.  Begin prototyping the core simulation flow and testing the Gemini API integration for question generation and feedback.
